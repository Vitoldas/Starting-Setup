# Getting Started Starting Setup

This React project was created in order to simplify the development process. It already contains eslint rules. Airbnb template was used for the purpose. 

Project structure was created with the help of atomic design guidebook by Brad Frost [https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/] but must be adjusted according to the needs of the project.

## 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### Reviewing error page.

You can review the error page by opening [http://localhost:3000/anyvalueThatIsNotRoutedTo](http://localhost:3000/anyvalueThatIsNotRoutedTo) once the project is already running to view it in your browser or add / with random characters to see that the error page works. The button can help you get back to the main page with the help of routing.

Styles can be used in the file of your choice by either adding base styles that will automatically @import all styles from the stylesheet or by choosing colors or other style you wish to import to your folder by using @import
